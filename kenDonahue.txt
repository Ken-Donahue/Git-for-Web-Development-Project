    5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the fix for the box model? 
        A box that surrounds an html element, and contains the content, padding, border, and margin. It often creates issues with inteded sizing specs, because
            you have to account for padding, border, and margin size on top of the displayed element. The model does not work well for responsive application.
                The "fix" is box-sizing:border-box.
